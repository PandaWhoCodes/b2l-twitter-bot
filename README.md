# b2l-twitter-bot

The current bot will have two processes

- main.py
- scheduled_tweets.py

Running side by side

- Main.py keeps a look out for tweets of a certain hashtag and then reply's to them
- scheduled_tweets sends a status check tweet to users in user_list.txt once a week.

TODO:
Add a flask app that will accept and populate this user list
